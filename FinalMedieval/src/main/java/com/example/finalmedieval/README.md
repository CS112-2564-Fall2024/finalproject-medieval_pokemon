# **MEDIEVAL POKEMON CHARACTER CREATOR**
### *Purpose:* 
This Medieval Pokemon Character Creator serves as a fun way to be able to design your own "Pokemon" card but with a medieval, DnD-like twist
which allows you to create your own character or, "Pokemon"!

### *Coding Approach:*
In order to accomplish this, I have coded a GUI using JavaFX as a framework for how the final product will work. Using buttons, labels, images, 
text fields, and combining them into a grid pane, this portion of my final project depicts how I intend the final Medieval Pokemon card to look.

*note:* I also have a concrete class created named "Weapon". This is only one of the many classes I intend to code that will affect the look and
stats of the character the user creates.

### *Goal:* 

The finalized product I intend to achieve will allow your created "Pokemon" to go into battle with a randomly generated enemy card (or a
a pre-set list of enemies that get more difficult as each round passes - still undecided).
