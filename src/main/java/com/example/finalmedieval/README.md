# **MEDIEVAL POKEMON CHARACTER CREATOR**
### *Purpose/UX:* 
This Medieval Pokemon Character Creator serves as a fun way to be able to design your own "Pokemon" card but with a medieval, DnD-like twist
which allows you to create your own character or, "Pokemon" by navigating through a UI to determine your Character's stats through your choice
of race, armor, and weapon.

### *Coding Approach:*
In order to accomplish this, I have coded a GUI using JavaFX as a framework for how the final product will work. Using buttons, labels, images, 
text fields, and combining them into a grid pane, this portion of my final project depicts how I intend the final Medieval Pokemon card to look.
